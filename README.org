* Fixed size list
** The purpose of this repository
   This repository contains the start of a class implementing
   fixed-size lists.

** List construction
   For simplicity, the fixed-sized array holding the elements of the
   list is passed to the constructor of the list. The maximum size of
   the list is then simply the length of this array. See =main()= for
   an example.

** Installation in IDEA
   To install the application in IDEA, do the following:
   1. Clone the repository.
   2. Right click on class =Main=.
   3. Select =Run Main.main()=
   You are now able to make changes to the project and run it again.

** Alternative installation from command line
   1. Clone repository.
   2. Inside repo, run =ant= to build the app.
   3. Run app with
      #+begin_src sh
        java -jar build/jar/Main.jar
      #+end_src
